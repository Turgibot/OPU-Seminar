<aside class="notes">This graph describes the log Intensity at a Single Pixel x over time.             As you can see a POSITIVE RED event was triggered everytime the log intensity increased passed a positive contrast sentitivity threshold -              And a NEGATIVE BLUE event was triggered everytime the log intensity descreased passed a negative contrast sentitivity threshold.</aside>
