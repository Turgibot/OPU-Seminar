<aside class="notes">Looking at the circuit diagram of a single pixel we can see that :             1. The photoreceptor diode connected to a logritmic calculation module.                2. That capacively copuled to a change amplifier that holds the previous signal value and out puts the differnce between the values of the current and previous signals.                     Everytime an event is triggered, this subcircuit gets reset and the current value is stored.                    3. Then the difference signal is driven into two comparators that detect on and off brigntness changes.                         If the signal went up and pass an 'ON' threshold  - an 'ON' event is triggered and viceversa for an 'OFF' event in the bottom comparator.</aside>
