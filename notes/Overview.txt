<aside class="notes">So the first topic that I would present today is neuromorphic stereo vision. Inorder for me to so, I would like to start by briefly giving you all some background information about the subject of conventional stereo vision.
             I'll also present some slides with information about neuromorphic cameras and then we'll dive for a deeper explanation of the neuromorphic stereo vision model, decribed in the paper I reviewed</aside>
