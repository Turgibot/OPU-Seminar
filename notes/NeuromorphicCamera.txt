<aside class="notes">Frame based camera algorithms of computer vision suffer from issues like high latency which depends on the exposure time of the camera            , motion blur and low dynamic range for example when there a strong light source in the camara's field of view.            but as we shall see, event cameras provide solotion to these problems. AKA DVS which stands for dynamic vision sensor or silicon retinas             are asynchronous sensors that pose a paradigm shift in the way visual information is aquired.                this is because their output depends on a scene dynamics and rather than on a clock that                    has no relation to the viewed scene.</aside>
