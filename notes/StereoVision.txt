<aside class="notes">So the first topic that I would present today is neuromorphic stereo vision. And I would like to start with the definition            of stereo vision. So Stereo-vision refers to the method of recovering depth information from both eyes, or in the artificial                 context, machine stereo vision, also referred to as stereoscopic vision, extracts the data from two visual sensors.                    It happends that the past 60 years of research have been devoted to frame based cameras whereas the article that i am introducing to                        you today uses a relatively new approach based of bio inspired event stereo camera. Some of you migh ask yourselves -                             what is an event camera and what is the difference between an event based to frame based camera?</aside>
