<aside class="notes">As I mentioned, the first topic that I would present today is neuromorphic stereo vision. And I would actually like to start with the definition            of stereo vision. So Stereo-vision refers to the method of recovering depth information from both eyes, or in the artificial                 context, machine stereo vision, also referred to as stereoscopic vision, extracts the data from two visual sensors.                    Here you can see 2 types of stereo cameras, the one on the right is a standard stereo camare that consists of two standard cameras,                         whereas the one on the left is a mount with a relatively new, bio inspired cameras that are called event cameras ...                    The past 60 years of research have been devoted to frame based cameras whereas the article that i am introducing to                        you today uses a relatively new approach based of the event stereo camera. Some of you migh ask yourselves -                             what is an event camera and what is the difference between a frame based to event based camera?</aside>
