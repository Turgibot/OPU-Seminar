<aside class="notes">Before diving into the first Article I would like to start with a short intro to neuromorphic stereo vision.             So Stereo-vision in general, refers to the method of recovering depth information from both eyes, or in the artificial                 context, machine stereo vision, or stereoscopic vision, extracts the data from two visual sensors.                    Here you can see 2 types of stereo cameras, the one on the right is a standard stereo camera that consists of two standard cameras,                         whereas the one on the left is a mount with pair of bio inspired cameras that are called event cameras ...                            As this is a noval neuromorphic hardware - The article that i am introducing to                                you today uses a neuromorphic approach, based on input fron an event stereo camera.                                     so what is an event camera and what is the difference between a frame based to event based camera?</aside>
