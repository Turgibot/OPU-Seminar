<aside class="notes">This is an example of a real output of an event camera where we have a guy catching a football, taken with a davis camera which is an event camera that outputs both events and frames.            In this case the the frame are being output at a rate of 6 Hz while a window of 10 milliseconds of events is shown. The frame data rate pick value mesured at th 30 kilo Hz which mean that                So we are talking of faster analysis of the data which is a great benefit especially in real-time applications.                     So you have heard me repeating the word 'EVENT' many times, so I would like to finish this introduction by talking about events are generated.</aside>
