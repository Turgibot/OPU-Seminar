<aside class="notes">Here we have a recording of a guy catching a football, taken with a davis camera which is an event camera that outputs both events and frames.            In this case the the frame are being output at a rate of 6 Hz while a window of 10 milliseconds of events is shown. The frame data rate pick value mesured at th 30 kilo Hz which mean that                So we are talking of faster analysis of the data which is a great benefit especially in real-time applications.                     So I said the word event many times, I would like to finish this introduction by talking about the event generation process.</aside>
