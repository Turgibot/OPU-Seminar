<aside class="notes">This is an example of a real output of an event camera where we have a guy catching a football, taken with a davis camera which is an event camera that outputs both events and frames.            In this case the the frame are being output at a rate of 6 Hz while a window of 10 milliseconds of events is shown. A very important fact to notice is that the data rate pick value was measured at 30 kilo Hz                 which is that of a microcontroller -                 So we are talking of faster analysis of the data which is a great benefit especially in real-time applications.</aside>
