<aside class="notes">When the disk rotates really fast, the standard camera undersamples and also blurs the images,            while an ideal event camera outputs is a tighter spiral of events.                 so as we can see , Although Event camera have been around only for a few years, it posesses outstanding properties             that have the potential of making strong impact in computer vision and robotics applications:                1. a very low latency with a resolution of microsecond                    2. no motion blur.                        3. ultra low power consumption - an event camera on average consumes 1 milliWatt instead of 1 Watt in standard camera.                            4. a very high dynamic range which is 8 orders of magnitude superior to a standard camera</aside>
