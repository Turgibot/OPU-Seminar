<aside class="notes">When looking at existing frame data we can say that algorithms of computer vision suffer from issues like high latency - due to redundant data analysis            , motion blur  - which depends on the exposure time of the camera,  and low dynamic range - which causes issues for example when there a strong light source in the camera's field of view.            but as we shall see, event cameras provide solutions to these problems.</aside>
