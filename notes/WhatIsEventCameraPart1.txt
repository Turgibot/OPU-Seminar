<aside class="notes">Known frame based camera algorithms of computer vision suffer from issues like high latency due to redundant data analysis            , motion blur which depends on the exposure time of the camera and low dynamic range which causes issues for example when there a strong light source in the camara's field of view.            but as we shall see, event cameras provide solutions to these problems.</aside>
