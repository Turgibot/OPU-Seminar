<aside class="notes">Machine stereo vision, or stereoscopic vision, extracts the data from two visual sensors.                    Here you can see 2 types of stereo cameras, the one on the right is a standard stereo camera that consists of two standard cameras,                         whereas the one on the left is a mount with pair of bio inspired cameras that are called event cameras ...                            As this is a noval neuromorphic hardware - The article that i am introducing to                                you today uses a neuromorphic approach, based on input fron an event stereo camera.                                     so what is an event camera and what is the difference between a frame based to event based camera?</aside>
