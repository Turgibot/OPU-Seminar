<aside class="notes">Event cameras were first commercialized in 2008 by Toby Delbruck from the university of Zurich             under the name of DVS which stands for Dynamic Vision Sensor.                 An event camera has smart pixels that are all                     independent of each other - every time that a single pixel detects motion, in the form of brightness change, that pixel trigers an event.                         This means that only motion in measured in the scene. </aside>
