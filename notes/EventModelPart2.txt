<aside class="notes">Looking at the circuit diagram of a single pixel we can see that :             1. The photoreceptor diode connected to a logritmic calculation module.                2. That capacively copuled to a change amplifier that gets reset everytime an event is triggered.                    3. Then that is driven into two comparators that detect on and off brigntness changes.                         If the signal went up and pass an on threshold an on event is triggered and viceversa for an off event in the bottom comparator.</aside>
