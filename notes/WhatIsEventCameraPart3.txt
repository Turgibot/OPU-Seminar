<aside class="notes">The animation on the bottom right of the screen from Davide Scaramuzza at the Robotics and perception group             in the University of Zurich, compares the outputs of a frame camera with an event camera.                    A rotating disk with a black circle is captured by the two camera types.                        On top you can see the output of a standard camera which are intensity frames at a constant time interval,                            while on the bottom you see the output of an event camera, which relates only to the moving black circle and represented as a spiral of events in space and time                                 where the red and blue colors represent the polarity of the event.</aside>
