<aside class="notes">In this slide we see conventional frames on the top and 2 different ways of visualizing the out put of an event camera on the bottom.             On the left we see a 3D space time visualization where the events are visualized in an x y t volume.                 BLUE corresponds to positive changes of intensity and The RED events correspond to negative change of intensity.                     On the right we see event in the form of frames, in this case each frame shows the events that were recorded in the last 10 milllseconds,                         However, this delta T parameter is configurable and we can go down in time to 1 micro-second.                            So how are events generated ???.</aside>
