<aside class="notes">As We have seen a traditional camera outputs frames at fixed time intervals,            By contrast, event camera outputs asynchronous events at microseconds resolution.                 An event is generated each time a single pixel detects an intensity changes value.                    each event consists of the following data:                         1. The timestamp at the time of the trigering.                             2. The x and y pixel coordinates in the sensor.                                 3. The event polarity (or sign) that get the value  of 1 or -1 for increase or decrease of brightness.</aside>
