<aside class="notes">Before I move on to reviewing the algorithm in the article, I just wanted to state that because the output of an event camera is asynchronous             and it posseses no intensity information - but only binary intensity changes, traditional vision algorithms that are used on regular frame data                  cannot be used on event camera data -             Therefor a paradigm shift needs to be applied and example of that is in the article : </aside>
