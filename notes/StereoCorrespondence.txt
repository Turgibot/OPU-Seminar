<aside class="notes">To better understand how depth is extracted from stereo data, lets take a look at two images taken by a stereo camera.            to calculate the depth in a certain point in the left image we first must find the corresponding point in the right image.                at this point we can assume that the images are rectified so they share the same y value.                     So the search for a corresponding point is limited to one row which limits the number of operation to the width of the image.                         but the solution is not that trivial because there might be more than a single match to a point.                             What we can do is to use a cost function like Sum of absolute differences of a window and not a point and return the position with the minimal cost.                                but that still might not be enough as we shall see at demo part of the presentation...</aside>
